# Poker Dealer

*A tool for offline Texas Hold'em dealing.*

### Usage:

1. Open the website: [cmu-poker.herokuapp.com](https://cmu-poker.herokuapp.com) or [auto-poker.herokuapp.com](https://auto-poker.herokuapp.com).

2. Join or create a room. If you don't provide a room id when create a room, we will generate a room for you.

3. Share the room id or the room url with your friends. Let your friends use their mobile phones open the website and join the room.

4. For who want to sit-down and play, click the Play button.

5. You can put an iPad in the middle of your table to act as the dealer. You should not click Play button on iPad, because the iPad is just a dealer instead of a player.

*P.S. If one of the players doesn't want to play anymore, just close the website, the `Poker Dealer` will not send cards to him in the next round.*

*P.P.S. If you want to hide your hole cards, click the Hide button.*
